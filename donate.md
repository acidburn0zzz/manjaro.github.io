Manjaro Linux survives because of the tireless efforts of many people in the community and the core development circle and having joy to develop on this great open source project!

There are many ways to help support Manjaro Linux. If technical development, documentation, or support aren’t your strong points, you could certainly help us by dropping a few bucks our way.

Many thanks!

 
## Use of Donations

In order to keep Manjaro.org independently, free from advertising and to be able to operate the webpage in normal speed, we would appreciate your financial support.

The donations will mainly cover the operating costs of the webserver. Any surplus may be for special activities (such as attending conferences and trade shows) used by Manjaro.org

 
## Conditions

- No rights or privileges are associated with a deposit.
- All donations are anonymous. Any sender details are not published or shared.
- A tax-related donation receipt can not be issued because Manjaro.org is not a commercial and registered organization.
- Legally, it is a private donation.

On the transfer form the word **donation** must be mentioned in the **purpose** area. Who also indicates his email address, receives on request a confirmation of receipt.
